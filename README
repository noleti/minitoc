README file for the minitoc package, version 61 (2014/07/24)

The minitoc package is useful to add mini-tables-of-contents (minitocs)
at the beginning of every chapter. They are also minilofs and minilots.
At the part level, they are parttocs, partlofs and partlots.
If the type of document does not use chapters, they are
section level secttocs, sectlofs and sectlots.

The list of the files is in minitoc.l.

The (long) history is now in the minitoc.dtx file, as part of the
documentation.

The installation is now described in the INSTALL file and the
minitoc.dtx file, as a chapter of the documentation.
